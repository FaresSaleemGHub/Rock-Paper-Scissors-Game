## 📄 Description
This is a fun and interactive Rock-Paper-Scissors game written in C++. You play against the computer in multiple rounds, and the program determines the winner of each round and the overall game.

## 🎮 Features
- Command-line interface with user prompts.
- Randomized computer choice using `rand()`.
- Multiple rounds support.
- Real-time effects using color changes and pauses.
- Displays game statistics including wins, draws, and final winner.
- Option to replay the game.

## 🛠️ Requirements
- A C++ compiler (e.g., g++, MSVC).
- Windows OS (uses `system("cls")` and `system("color")`).

## ⚙️ Installation
### 📦 Prerequisites
- A C++ compiler:
  - [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/) for Windows
  - GCC for Linux
  - Xcode Command Line Tools for macOS

### 🧭 Steps
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/FaresSaleemGHub/Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game.git
   
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game
3. Compile the program:
   ```bash
   g++ -o Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game Rock-Paper-Scissors-Game.cpp
4. Run the game:
   ```bash

## 🧠 How It Works
- You select the number of rounds.
- In each round, you pick Stone (1), Paper (2), or Scissor (3).
- The computer randomly selects a choice.
- The game compares choices and updates the score.
- After all rounds, the game displays:
-- Number of wins for the player and computer.
-- Number of draws.
-- Final winner.
- You can replay the game as many times as you'd like.
